# Clone Project
_By Cameron Button_

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0.

## Description

This portfolio project is intended to be a clone of the Steam website found at https://store.steampowered.com/.  The intent behind it is to have a page where a game developer may make an account and put their games up for sale; this includes making a price for their game, a description, photos, and adding update posts about the state of the game.

## Planning

  * Landing page where user can make a "developer" profile.
  * Page then shows the developer profile and a list of their published games (initial list should be empty).
  * The dev profile allows the user to make blog posts about their games, add new games to their published games list, and edit their posts and games.
  * Each game will have at _least_ a title, description, price, and an image.

  _notes_

    Going by my planning there needs to be a game component, a new-game component, a list of games component, and a developer-profile component.  The game component will need its own model.





##### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

##### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

##### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

##### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

##### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
